#DESCRIPTION

*A personal portfolio website developed using HTML, CSS, and Font Awesome icons to showcase my web development skills, projects, and contact information. The website features a clean, responsive layout with a fixed navigation bar, smooth scrolling between sections (Home, About, Projects, Contact), and a modern aesthetic.*

*Designed in VS Code, this project reflects my ability to build structured and user-friendly web pages. It demonstrates my understanding of semantic HTML, CSS layouts (Flexbox/Grid), component styling, and basic responsive design principles. The site acts as both a professional showcase and a platform to connect with potential employers or clients.*
